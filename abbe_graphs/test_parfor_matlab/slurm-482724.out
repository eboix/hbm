{Error using parallel.Cluster/parpool (line 81)
You requested a minimum of 4 workers, but the cluster "local" has the
NumWorkers property set to allow a maximum of 1 workers. To run a communicating
job on more workers than this (up to a maximum of 512 for the Local cluster),
increase the value of the NumWorkers property for the cluster. The default
value of NumWorkers for a Local cluster is the number of cores on the local
machine.
